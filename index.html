            <p> I got to know about Altschool from a close friend of mine,and then i went to their website to make more research and fell i in love with the system,instantly i developed the urge to be part of the team.I am a newbie in the tech world and i felt, I needed a touch of professionalism to be a world class programmer so i applied on their registration site read, prepared for the entrance examination and aced it with a score of 92%.AFter that i was given a student id which validate our studentships mine is <b>ALT/SOE/023/2839</b> .And my current track is Cloud Engineering.
                The school is online based and all clases and school activities are virtual. The school of engineering which i applied for, is  further divided into three tracks which are basically;
                  <blockquote>
                   <cite><ul>
                    <li>Frontend Engineering</li>
                    <li>Backend Engineering</li>
                    <li>Cloud Engineering</li>
                   </ul></cite>
                  </blockquote>
                  Aside the school of enginering is the school of product.
